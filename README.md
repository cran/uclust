# Uclust: Clustering and Classification Inference for HDLSS Data with U-Statistics

## Package may be downloaded on CRAN

  Clustering and classification inference for high dimension low sample size data
   with U-statistics. The package contains implementations of nonparametric statistical
   tests for sample homogeneity, group separation, clustering, and classification of 
   multivariate data. The methods have high statistical power and are tailored for data
   in which the dimension L is much larger than sample size n. 


## The package contains functions for nonparametric tests:

* Bn test for group separation with 2 or 3 predefined groups
* Overall group homogeneity testing
* Clustering of a sample into the best two our three significant subgroups
* Hierarchical clustering considering only significant subgroups
* Significant classification of a new observation into one of two predefined groups
